## GitHub Pages Deployment Notes

1. If GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from `gh-pages` branch `/(root)`, the root `index.html` acts as a redirect page and forwards visitors to `https://fernand.tech/`.
2. If GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from `gh-pages` branch `/docs`, it serves the Notion-rendered static site directly (effectively the same destination as the redirect result).
